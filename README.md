# Sleeky
A simple public interface for YOURLS with features such as custom url creation and easy customisation

##Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open index.php in a text editor of your choice. Notepad, Brackets, Text Edit or something similar should do the trick.
3. At the top of the file are all the options in the theme. For example $siteTitle option changes the title of the webpage. Feel free to go through and change each of the variables to suit your site. Make sure you type your setting inside the inverted commas.
4. Once you have changed all the variables to suit, save the file and upload the contents of the repo to your YOURLS install directory.
5. Thatâ€™s it, it you visit your YOURLS install website, you should see the Sleeky theme!
